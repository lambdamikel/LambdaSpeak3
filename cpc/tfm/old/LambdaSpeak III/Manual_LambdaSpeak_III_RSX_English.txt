Before you use this RSX expansion, you shall use the command |LSINIT (English mode) or 
|LSINIC (Catalan/Spanish Mode) to enable all the features of the great LambdaSpeak III.
If not, the LS3 will just behave like the Amstrad SSA-1 speech synthesizer!


LambdaSpeak III Speech Synthesizer, Drum Machine, Sample Player, Real-Time-Clock and MP3/WAV Player
===================================================================================================

This is a new generation speech synthesizer which emulates/simulates the following expansions:

- EPSOM mode    / - These modes provide different voices and can even sing!
- DECtalk mode /
- dk'tronics SPEECH synthesizer
- Amstrad SSA1 synthesizer
- Amdrum drum kit
- PCM Sample player
- MP3 / WAV player
- Real-Time-Clock
- MIDI (with little expansion cars, connected via serial connection)


Software support: ROM with RSX commands, Z80 library, FutureOS and some games


RSX Library for the LambdaSpeak III expansion interface
-------------------------------------------------------
To use the RSX commands you either put disc in your drive and type: run"disc
Or you can install the "LS3.ROM" as an expansion ROM. It contains all RSX commands and more.

Before we start:
----------------
To use LambdaSpeak III in the mighty Epson mode you type the RSX command |LSINIT or |LSINIC.
This initializes LambdaSpeak III, which is in SSA1 mode when you switch on your CPC or Plus.

Commands to control LambdaSpeak III:
------------------------------------

Attention: One of the two following commands shall be used before you can use the power of LambdaSpeak III

|LSINIT: Initializes the LambdaSpeak III when using the LambdaSpeak III ROMs. The following steps are carried out: 
         The passing of parameters is switched to 'fast' (using |GETFAST), the language is set to English (|ENGLISH), 
         the Blocking is set to OFF (|BLOCKOFF), the mode is set to Epson (|LAMBDA) and the speech delay is set to a 
         minimum (20 ms) (|SETDELAY,1).

|LSINIC: Initializes the LambdaSpeak III when using the LambdaSpeak III ROMs. The following steps are carried out: 
         The passing of parameters is switched to 'fast' (using |GETFAST), the language is set to Spanish (|SPANISH), 
         the Blocking is set to OFF (|BLOCKOFF), the mode is set to Epson (|LAMBDA) and the speech delay is set to a 
         minimum (20 ms) (|SETDELAY,1).

|RESET.: This is like to switch OFF and ON the LambdaSpeak III. It switches LambdaSpeak III into the dk'tronics mode.

|STOP..: Stops the current output of language (only in non blocking mode).
         Attention: You need to completely unblock the LambdaSpeak III using |BLOCKOFF and |XBLKOFF before using |STOP.

|WAIT..: Waits until LambdaSpeak III is ready. This means port &FBEE equals &20 or &80.


Commands to select the LambdaSpeak III mode:
--------------------------------------------

|LAMBDA...: Selects the powerful Epson mode.

|DECTALK..: Selects the DECtalk mode, it even can sing songs.

|SSA1.....: Switches to the Amstrad SSA-1 mode. The LambdaSpeak III now emulates the Amstrad SSA-1 speech synthesizer.
|SSASP0...: Like the SSA1 mode, but uses the SP0256-AL2 chip onboard (like the real thing from Amstrad).

|DKTRONICS: Switches to the dk'tronics mode. The LambdaSpeak III now emulates the dk'tronics SPEECH synthesizer.
|DKSP0....: Like the dk'tronics mode, but uses the SP0256-AL2 chip onboard (like the real thing from dk'tronics).

|AMDRUM...: Switches to the Amdrum mode. The LambdaSpeak III now emulates the AMDRUM drum system.
            This mode needs to be activated when using the RSX commands |PLAY and |EPLAY to play Amdrum samples.
            Attention: This mode can only be left by switching the CPC / LambdaSpeak III OFF and ON again!

|PCMMODE..: Switches to PCM mode. In this mode PCM samples of the 128 KB EEPROM can be played.
            Attention: This mode can only be left by pressing the Reset_LambdaSpeak III button on the LS3 board.


Commands to select parameters of the LambdaSpeak III expansion
--------------------------------------------------------------

|SETVOLUME,0-15: Sets the volume to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard volume.

|SETVOICE,0-15: Sets the voice to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard voice.

|SETSPEED,0-15: Sets the speed of speaking to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard speaking speed.

|SETDELAY,0-15: Sets the delay to a value between 1 and 15. The value 0 select the standard delay.
                With the 'delay' the time is indicated, which will pass before the LS starts talking after 
                sending the last character to it.

|ENGLISH: Switches the language to English.

|SPANISH: Switches the language to Spanish.

|BLOCKON and |BLOCKOFF: These two commands switch the 'Blocking' on and off for 'User content'.
                        If the 'Blocking' is switched on, then the LambdaSpeak III will HALT the CPC until
                        all characters have been spoken and the LambdaSpeak III is ready again.

|XBLKON and |XBLKOFF: These two commands switch 'Blocking' on and off for 'Confirmations'.
                      If the 'X Blocking' is switched on, then the LambdaSpeak III will HALT the CPC until
                      the actual 'Confirmation' was spoken and the LambdaSpeak III is ready again.

|CONFON and |CONFOFF: These two commands switch the 'Conformations' on and off. If the 'Conformations' are switche on,
                      the LambdaSpeak III will tell you all alterations (f.e. mode, language etc.) acoustically.

|GETFAST, |GETMED and |GETSLOW: These commands influence the length of the time span the LambdaSpeak III will provide 
                                parameters on the bus for the CPC. The LS3 shows data for 10 us, 50 us or 20 ms.
                                For quick machine code the 'fast' mode should be used. As for FutureOS. 10 us.
                                For regular machine code the 'medium' mode should be used. As for the RSX commands. 50 us.
                                For BASIC programs (using IN and OUT commands) the mode should be switched to 'slow' = 20 ms.
