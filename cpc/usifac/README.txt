A few MAXAM demo programs that require USIfAC I for MIDI INPUT.
Connect the MIDI BREAKOUT BOARD to the USIfAC I UART headers. These
programs have not been tested with USIfAC II - I don't own one!

So, these are the programs on "newusi.dsk": 

- SP0SYNT: play LambdaSpeak III's SP0256-AL2 and the CPC's AY sound
  chip over USIfAC MIDI IN. Requires standard LambdaSpeak III with
  SP0256-AL2 chip option.

Note that there is really no need to use USIfAC for LambdaSpeak III.
LambdaSpeak III has it's own MIDI-capable UART. The purpose of this
program is to demonstrate MIDI input with USIfAC.

The other programs don't apply to LambdaSpeak III; they are for
Speak&SID. See there.
